# Smart Energy Forecasting for Sustainable Buildings Using AI

This project is part of my Week 1 internship task. The goal is to prepare data for predicting energy usage in buildings using supervised learning.

##  Steps Done in Week 1

- Uploaded the dataset `2018Floor1.csv`
- Cleaned missing values
- Converted date column to datetime format
- Extracted time-based features: hour, day, month, weekday
- Selected input and output columns
- Split the data into training and testing sets

## Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

##  File

- `SmartEnergyg_Forcasting.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with all the code

##  Internship Week 1 Milestone

This notebook completes the Week 1 milestone for the AI internship program.

##  Internship Week 2 Assessment â€“ Model Training and Evaluation

In Week 2, I completed two tasks:

1. **Model Training**  
   - Trained two supervised learning models:  
     - Linear Regression  
     - Random Forest Regressor

2. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Evaluated both models using:  
     - RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)  
     - RÂ² Score

###  Results:
- **Linear Regression**  
  RMSE: 6.86  
  RÂ² Score: 0.30

- **Random Forest Regressor**  
  RMSE: 1.07  
  RÂ² Score: 0.98

### ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

###  Notebook File
- `Smart Energy Forecasting.ipynb`: Contains all Week 2 code and outputs

###  Conclusion:
Random Forest Regressor performed better and is suitable for forecasting lighting energy usage. This completes the Week 2 milestone.
